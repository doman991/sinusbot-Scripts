**Username Checker Script**

This script for SinusBot checks usernames upon user connection and when usernames are changed. If a username contains any of the specified banned phrases, the user will be kicked from the server.

**Warning:** When adding banned phrases, be cautious of substrings that might unintentionally match common parts of usernames. For example, short phrases like "adm" or "ceo" might unintentionally match parts of usernames and result in unintended kicks.
